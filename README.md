## A bit more about my experience...

I took this course during the early summer of 2018 as I was starting my
internship with Oseberg.

I was working as a data analytics intern, performing churn prediction analysis
with the help of python, SQL, MixPanel and a few other tools. However, I had
very little experience in R and wanted to start helping refactor some of the
company's legacy reporting software that was written in R. Oseberg has a great
culture around continuous education and supported my desire to learn more about
programming in R. I worked on this bootcamp course in part from home and in part
from the office.

Though I did not have an opportunity to inplement any of the advanced machine
learning topics, the introduction to data analysis and visualization served
me greatly during my internship.
